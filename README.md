# RBAC Project by PHP

- This **educational project** provides a basic implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using PHP and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- It was created to explore fundamental concepts in computer science, algorithms, and design patterns

## 1. Core Functionality

The system includes essential features for:

- **User registration**
- **Authorization**
- **Authentication**

It is built around three primary classes:

- `User`
- `Role`
- `Permission`

And two relational classes:

- `UserRole`
- `RolePermission`

## 2. Current Features

- PHP with **PDO extension**
- Basic **OOP structure**
- **Prepared SQL statements**
- Fundamental **SQL operations**

## 3. Planned Enhancements

- PHP: `Hash`, `SPL`, `Data Structures`, `Sessions` (optional), `OAuth` (optional)
- Implementation of **PSR standards**
- Integration with **PHPUnit** for testing
- Optional **multi-factor authentication**
- Use of **design patterns** and **algorithms**
- Introduction of **frameworks**
- Use of **abstract classes** and **interfaces**

## 4. System Logic Overview

- Verify if a user has a specific role
- Verify if a role includes a specific permission
- The `Auth` class handles core authentication logic
- The `WorkDB` class manages database queries
- The `Query` class stores all SQL statements

## 5. Notes

This project is intended for **learning purposes** and may evolve over time.  
Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome.
